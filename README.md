# Nissan-LEAF-Battery-Upgrade
So you are looking to upgrade the battery in your LEAF? You've come to the right place for information and software/hardware required. Take some time to familiarize with the content.

## Read this first 
Start by reading all the terminology and info about what a battery upgrade, direct upgrade, paring, CAN-bridges etc. is by following this link to the wiki: https://github.com/dalathegreat/Nissan-LEAF-Battery-Upgrade/wiki

## Getting the hardware
The BatteryUpgrade software runs on both the Muxsan 3-port CAN-bridge, and on the 2-port Budget CAN-bridge. This guide focuses on the 2-port since it is the easiest to source at the moment. Here are some purchase links

- 2-port https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-mb-can-filter-18-in-1.html 
- 3-port https://www.tindie.com/products/muxsan/can-mitm-bridge-3-port-rev-25/

Note, for 2-port it has to be the BLUE PCB, the other varients are not supported.

## Software needed to make changes to code
- Keil uVision5

## Software needed to flash
- STM32 ST-LINK Utility https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link004.html

## Hardware needed to flash
- ST Link V2 (can be purchased for around 10‚Ç¨ on ebay / amazon / local electronics store)

## Flashing instructions
Flash with BridgeFlasher.exe located in software folder. The compiled .srec files are located in output folder. For ST LINK CLI, point the exe towards the "ST-LINK_CLI.exe" located in the "STM32 ST-LINK Utility" folder that appears after installing it.

This is what the BridgeFlasher.exe should look like. Press Start to flash.

Connect the ST Link V2 to the J1 ports on the PCB. It can be hard to connect dupont wires here, so I recommend getting needle pins. 

7 3.3V  	- J1

Nothing 	- J2

3 GND   	- J3

2 SWDIO   - J4

6 SWCLK   - J5

## Wiring in the hardware
When installing the 2-port into the vehicle, here are the wiring instructions:
¬∑ Red wire #1 -> +12V constant (fuse with 3A)
¬∑ Red wire #2 -> +12V constant (fuse with 3A, join together with other red wire)
¬∑ Purple -> EV-CAN Low, Green wire (battery side)
¬∑ Green -> EV-CAN High, Blue wire (battery side)
¬∑ Yellow -> EV-CAN Low, Green wire (vehicle side)
¬∑ Blue -> EV-CAN High, Blue wire (vehicle side)
¬∑ Black -> Ground
¬∑ Black -> Ground

Here is an example on a 2012 LEAF:

## Dependencies üìñ
This code was made possible with the help of Muxsan and their excellent 3-port hardware. Also massive thanks to my Patreon Glen for introducing me to the 2-port alternative.
